"Email-Analysis" 

Continuous Email Scanning Code
This Python script is designed to scan emails from a Gmail account for malicious content, focusing mainly on URLs. Using the imaplib and email libraries, it connects to the inbox, retrieves unread emails, and then extracts the URLs present in each message. For each URL, it performs a check using the VirusTotal and URLhaus APIs to assess their safety. If suspicious URLs are detected, the email is moved to a quarantine label for further analysis. In addition, a report detailing the scan is generated and saved to a file, allowing for traceability of potential threats. This script is an effective solution to enhance the security of email communications.
